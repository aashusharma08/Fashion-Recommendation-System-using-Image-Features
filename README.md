# Fashion-Recommendation-System-using-Image-Features

## Introduction
The **Fashion Recommendation System** is a deep learning-based project that suggests similar clothing items based on an input image. It uses a **pre-trained VGG16 model** to extract image features and compute similarity scores to recommend the most visually similar fashion items.

## Features
- Uses **VGG16 model** (pre-trained on ImageNet) for feature extraction.
- Computes **cosine similarity** to find visually similar items.
- Works with a dataset of fashion images.
- Provides recommendations based on similarity scores.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.12.4
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fashion-recommendation.git
   cd fashion-recommendation
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure you have the necessary dataset of fashion images.

## Usage
1. **Feature Extraction:**
   Run the script to extract features from images and save them:
   ```bash
   python feature_extraction.py
   ```
2. **Find Similar Items:**
   To get recommendations for an input image:
   ```bash
   python recommend.py --image path/to/input/image.jpg
   ```
3. The system will output the top N most similar images.

## How It Works
- The system loads a dataset of clothing images.
- Each image is passed through the VGG16 model to extract deep features.
- Features are stored and indexed.
- When a query image is given, its features are extracted and compared with stored features using cosine similarity.
- The top N similar images are retrieved and displayed.

## Example Output
The system will return a set of images similar to the input image.

## Future Improvements
- Implement a web interface using Flask.
- Expand the dataset for better recommendations.
- Improve accuracy with fine-tuning on a fashion-specific dataset.
- Add user preferences for personalized recommendations.
